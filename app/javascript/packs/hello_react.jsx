// Run this example by adding <%= javascript_pack_tag 'hello_react' %> to the head of your layout file,
// like app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. All it does is render <div>Hello React</div> at the bottom
// of the page.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
